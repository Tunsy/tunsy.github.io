                            Synopsis: For decades, humanity has traveled to neighboring solar systems, in search of sentient life and a habitable world. Although technology has allowed for prolonged life, fit for space travel, society crumbles on Earth as resources deplete. In desperate pursuit of a new world, a select few every five years become augmented and travel to prospective planets, never to return. You are an augmented traveler on a planet eerily similar to Earth. Further exploration of this mysterious world unveils an anomaly amidst the barren landscape; a standing castle resembling medieval architecture of your old world.

                            Sanctum Breach is a Unity based top down action game programmed in C#. A small team of four developed this game, led by yours truly! It was a pretty ambitious first project, involving Enemy AI, creating a tile editor, and a variety of levels, bosses, and traps. As project leader, I was involved in programming, sound, art, design, etc. I also had to teach my team members how to use Unity as I was the only one with experience at the time. Overall, it was a great experience, and I learned a lot about programming, leadership, and project management.

                            I first joined Fremont High Schools robotics team when I was in high school. I was able to get hands on experience  with engineering and this was the first time I got involved in the STEM community. After I graduated, I decided to become a mentor for the team. I thought I would be a valuable asset to the team as I had experience with working on the robot, and as a student, I could relate to the students more so than the other mentors. I am a mentor for both the software team and the media and public relations team.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As a software mentor, I am tasked with inspiring the students and making engineering exciting for them. I did this by guiding them on how to solve real life problems involved in engineering and teaching them how to program and work with the WPI library. As a media and public relations mentor, I helped work on design and branding. I helped the MPR team with animation and graphic design and the website. Additionally, I worked on the logos and T-shirt designs for the team.

                            Synopsis: All your life, you have lived behind the city walls, where the beasts can't get you. The city has been guarded by a magical barrier for centuries. Legends say there was a time when beasts and humans once lived in harmony, and thrived together. But one day, they lost their minds reverted to their natural instincts. Humanity was no match for these hyper intelligent beasts. Gods raised this barrier centuries ago to protect the last of humanity. However, there is a witch out there with her army of beasts trying to defy these gods. Do you have what it takes to restore peace to humanity?

                            BeastLand is a Unity based arcade beat em up RPG programmed in C#. It is heavily inspired by Castle Crashers and River City Ransom with its RPG beat em up genre, and retro NES inspired graphics. I was interested in creating a simple RPG this time around, and was involved in creating the level up system and stat system, skill shop system, combat system, and dialog system. Leading this project also helped me become a better leader, as I was managing a a team of seven people this time around.

                            During my time at Fremont High School, I made various designs and T-shirts for many clubs that I was involved in. Some of these clubs included Octagon, Robotics, and DECA.

                            Famine games is an online 3D king of the hill style deathmatch game. Up to 8 players are pitted against each other in an arena with no weapons and armor. Players have to find items and treasure chests randomly generated around the map in order to arm themselves against each other. Points are gained by killing each other or capturing the control point. The first person to reach the preset number of points wins!

                            This game was created mainly as a learning experience for me and my team. I have always encouraged my team to push our limits and learn new things, so taking on a 3D project seemed like the logical next step after our two previous 2D projects. I was heavily involved in the weapon system, level design, and networking. I also had to learn how to work with and teach netcode to my team. This project proved to be both very ambitious and difficult, but my team and I learned a lot from it.

                            Vroom is a virtual reality drivers ed simulator created in less than 24 hours for HackDavis 2016. The goal was to create a drivers ed test as accurately as possible by simulating the use of traffic signals, stop signs, pedestrians, turn signals, mirrors, and even obstacles like other cars, the curb, or parking. Our hope was for driving students to use it to develop muscle memory for driving in a safe environment by using our makeshift gas pedal from a rock band drum kick pedal, and a steering wheel controller. I was heavily involved in teaching my team how to use Unity, programming the traffic and car physics, and level creation.

                            Developers' Guild is a project based computer science club at De Anza College. We are a club that puts emphasis on getting hands on experience developing software and projects as a team. People are taught how to program, solve real life problems, collaborate in teams, and build leadership and communication skills. We also encourage students to broaden their horizons and learn new things. We have a variety of projects led by our very passionate and talented project leaders, so whether people have an interest in apps, games, or web development, we have a project for them.

                            I joined Developers' Guild my first quarter at De Anza, and since then have become the president. I have lead various projects during my time there. The success of the club is also in my hands and the club has been very successful so far as I place emphasis on helping the club officers and ensuring the success of every individual project. I have also been involved in rebranding the club and worked on the logo and website.
